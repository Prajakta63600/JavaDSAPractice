Learning from basics of java to Advanced to  up skill my automation coding logic

2D arrays in Java-> It is nothing but calculated in matrix format which is rows*columns
syntax: type[][] name = new type[size][size];
Has it travers from rows to coloumn then the approch is to use nested for loop.
Added 3 progrmas to understand 2D Array
1. TwoDArray-> Prints the user give martix in console
2. TwoDArrayMatchXValue-> Match the given x value  by user from given matrix.
3. TwoDArrayTransposeMatrix-> Print the transpose matrix of given matrix by user.

02/09/2025-> Today Learning
String and String Methods-> Group of characters.
Added 3 progrmas to understand String menthods like charAt(), using array.
1. StringArray->Take an array of Strings input from the user & find the cumulative (combined) length of all those strings.
2. StringReplaceWord->Input a string from the user. Create a new string called ‘result’ in which you will replace the letter ‘e’ in the original string with letter ‘i’. 
Example : 
original = “eabcdef’ ; result = “iabcdif”
Original = “xyz” ; result = “xyz”
3. SubStringUserName-> Input an email from the user. You have to create a username from the email by deleting the part that comes after ‘@’. Display that username to the user.
Example : 
email = “apnaCollegeJava@gmail.com” ; username = “apnaCollegeJava” 
email = “helloWorld123@gmail.com”; username = “helloWorld123”
